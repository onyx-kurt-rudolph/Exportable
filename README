Exportable
==========

This plugin was created to to provide a means of exporting models to xml|json, 
while substituting the surrogate keys (id attributes) with the natural key of the
belongs_to association.  For example:

class Forum < ActiveRecord::Base
  validates_uniqueness_of :name
end

class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  validates_uniqueness_of :subject, :scope => [:post_at]
  belongs_to :forum
end

Post.export_options
=> { :include => {:forum => {:only => [:name]}}, :except => [:id, :forum_id]}

This option hash can then be passed to either the to_json or to_xml calls.

This plugin defines several methods included in all models.  It also defines
two modules Exportable::Export and Exportable::Import which contain helper
methods for creating and ingesting xml|json documents.

The plugin relies on each model defining a validates_uniqueness_of rule in
order to determine the natural key for each model.  The plugin only processes
belongs_to associations, not has_many relationships.


Example
=======



Methods
=======

In each model:

export_options
=> yields an options has which can be passed to to_json and to_xml

Exportable::Export

dump_klass_to_<json|xml> (klass, directory)

Limitations
===========

-In order to process models with polymorphic belongs_to associations, you must
use one of the following methods from Exportable::Export:

<json|xml>_batches or dump_klass_to_<json|xml>

-If a table contains binary data, currently only xml dumps work.
